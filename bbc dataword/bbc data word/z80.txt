 This sample database describes some 
 of the Z80 microprocessors hardware
 organisation and its addressing modes
 with examples.
ÿ
 Registers followed by width <x> in
 bits.

 A  <8>  Working accumulator.

 F  <8>  Flag register.

 B,C<8>  Register pairs can be operated
 D,E     on as 16 bits quantities.
 H,L

 IX <16> Index register.
 IY <16> Index register.
 SP <16> Stack pointer.
 PC <16> Program counter.

 I  <8>  Interrupt register.

 There also exists a duplicate set of
 registers namely A', F', B', C', D',
 E', H' and L'. These can be 'paged in'
 by a special instruction. Only one set
 may be used at a time.
ÿ Address mode : Implied

 Description  :

 This mode is used on inter register
 transfers and operations. They are
 single byte and single cycle
 instructions.

 Example : LD A,B

 Transfer B to A.
ÿ Address mode : Immediate

 Description  :

 There are two types of addressing, 8
 or 16 bit. Depending on the length they
 are either two or three bytes long.

 Example : LD A,23

 Load accumulator with 23 decimal.
ÿ Address mode : Absolute

 Description  :

 This where an absolute address is
 specified as the absolute location. It
 is sometimes known as 'extended'
 addressing to distinguish it from 8 bit
 relative addressing.

 Example : LD HL,(nn)

 Load HL pair from memory nn.
ÿ Address mode : Modified Zero-Page

 Description  :

 Only one instruction namely RST.
 Within the opcode is a 3 bit field
 which points to one of eight locations
 in zero page which are eight bytes
 apart. This vectors the processor PC to
 a small piece of code.

 Example : RST
ÿ Address mode : Relative

 Description  :

 This requires two bytes firstly a jump
 relative opcode and then the signed
 offset which the PC will jump to.

 Example : JR NZ,e

 Jump relative if Not Zero.
ÿ Address mode : Indexed

 Description  :

 Index addressing is useful for
 accessing a table of values in memory
 in sequential order. The instruction
 specifies a memory address plus and
 index register. At run time the two are
 added together to form the address.

 Example : LD A,(IX+d)

 Load accumulator with memory pointed
 at by index register IX plus a signed
 displacement d.
ÿ Address mode : Indirect

 Description  :

 For different programs to access a
 common table in memory it is usual to
 provide an address which contains a
 pointer to it. When loaded with the
 address of the table it can then be
 accessed relative to the initial
 address.

 Example : LD IX,(nn)

 Load index register with the contents
 of address nn and nn+1.
