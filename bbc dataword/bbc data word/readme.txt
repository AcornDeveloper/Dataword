Memory

The different Acorn versions of
DataWord have different free memory
pools for the database. They are as
follows:
 
Master             9K
Compact            9K
BBC B              2K
Electron           2K

If you transfer long files from a 
version with more memory they may
be truncated.
ÿ
On Mode 7 versions the hard spaces
do not show. Consequently the toggle
to make them visible or invisible
doesn't work

Delays

Some functions such as format can
take some time to complete. Do not 
press Escape while you are waiting.
ÿ
Six demonstration files are supplied.
On tapes they follow this ReadMe file
in the order given. On disc they have
the names shown:

Highway: A test of the highway code.
Trivia: Some general knowledge questions
Words: A lesson in using words
Primes: British Prime Ministers
6502: 6502 programming instructions
Z80: Z80 programming instructions

Note: Some of these files are too long
for the Mode6 version and therefore the
last few records will not be displayed.
