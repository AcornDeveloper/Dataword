 This sample database lists some of
 the 6502 microprocessors hardware
 organisation and its addressing
 modes with examples.
ÿ
 Registers followed by width <x> in
 bits.

 A  <8>  Working accumulator.

 X  <8>  Index register.
 Y  <8>  Index register.

 SR <8>  Processor status flags.
 SP <16> Stack pointer.
 PC <16> Program counter.
ÿ Address mode : Implicit

 Description  :

 The addressing mode is does not need to
 be specified as it is implicit in the
 instruction itself.

 Example : RTS

 Return from subroutine.
ÿ Address mode : Accumulator

 Description  :

 These instructions either operate on
 the accumulator or a memory location.

 Example : ASL A

 Shift accumulator contents one bit to
 the left.
ÿ Address mode : Immediate

 Description  :

 This is the mode whereby an immediate
 specified data constant is loaded in.

 Example : LDA #23

 Load accumulator with 23 decimal.
ÿ Address mode : Absolute

 Description  :

 This where an absolute address is
 specified at the time of assembly. This
 is taken as a 16 bit address.

 Example : LDX &1200

 Load X register with the contents of
 location (hex) 1200.
ÿ Address mode : Zero page

 Description  :

 This is the same as absolute except
 that the memory location is in the
 first 256 bytes of memory.

 Example : CMP &40

 Compare accumulator with the contents
 of location (hex) 40.
ÿ Address mode : Indirect

 Description  :

 This specifies a two byte location
 whose contents contains a 16 bit
 address.

 Example : JMP (nn)

 Jump to the address contained in
 locations nn and nn+1.
ÿ Address mode : X,Y Absolute

 Description  :

 Index addressing is useful for
 accessing a table of values in memory
 in sequential order. The instruction
 specifies a memory address plus and
 index register. At run time the two are
 added together to form the address.

 Example : LDA &1400,Y

 Load accumulator with memory pointed
 at by index register Y plus the
 constant (hex) 1400.
ÿ Address mode : Zero page,X

 Description  :

 This is the same as the absolute X,Y
 addressing except that a zero page
 address is specified. You may only use
 the X register with the mode.

 Example : LDA &70,X

 Load accumulator with the memory
 contents pointed to by the X register
 plus the constant (hex) 70.
ÿ Address mode : Pre-indexed indirect

 Description  :

 A table of 16 bit pointers in zero
 page is accessed using the X register
 and an eight bit base constant.


 Example : LDA (&70,X)

 The address computed from the constant
 (hex) 70 plus the X register contains a
 16 bit address from which the
 accumulator is loaded.
ÿ Address mode : Post-indexed indirect

 Description  :

 At the address specified in page zero
 there is a 1 bit address. This is then
 added to the Y register to form an
 address from which the accumulator is
 loaded.

 Example : LDA (&70),Y

 Load accumulator with the memory
 contents of the zero page (hex) 70 and
 71 plus the Y register.
ÿ Address mode : Relative

 Description  :

 This mode allows an address to be
 specified relative to the present
 instruction address. This is added to
 the program counter to execute a jump
 -128 or +127 bytes from the current
 location.

 Example : BCC loop

 Branch on carry clear to loop which is
 a label defined as a memory location.
